## Target Audience
Some podcasters release their episodes on different platforms with different intro recordings or advertisements. The content is the same, but the episode timestamps are different because the intros and ads are different.

## Problem Addressed
Existing solutions that only allow adjusting one timestamp at a time, and adjusting 10+ timestamps for a 1.5-hour episode is a tedious process.

## Features
1. Adjust timestamps in bulk!
2. Bold, italic, and underline formatting for the output timestamps
3. Fully responsive and mobile-friendly
